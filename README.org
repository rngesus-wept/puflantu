* Installing and Contributing

*** Dependencies

    * [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][Python 3.7+]] :: Python 3 would technically be good enough but 3.7 is the
         version the virtual environment happens to be installed to.
    * [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/][pip]] :: Be sure that you install a version compatible with Python 3.7;
         depending on your system package manager, this may be under the `pip3`
         name (with `pip` defaulting to Python 2).
    * [[https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/][pipenv]] :: This allows you to isolate this project's dependencies in its
         own virtual environment, without affecting your main Python
         installation.

### Notes

Footholds given to teams: The note is accompanied by a picture of a sphinx. "What" and "puzzle" are English cognates. The number sequence (4-2-3) is easily identifiable if numbers are given by a different artifact.

Note the Spanish-style phrasing in the second line; the dependent clause is written as "... puzzles please you", not "... you like puzzles".

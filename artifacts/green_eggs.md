I am Sam / Sam I am  
`Wm Zamu zwm. / Zamu wm zat.`

That Sam-I-am! / That Sam-I-am! / I do not like that Sam-I-am!  
`Iqa Zamu-wm-zat! / Iqa Zamu-wm-zat! / Iqa Zamu-wm-zat somateyumun!`  
(`som-(at-ey-um)-un` - `please-3S-1O-NEG`, it does not please me)

---

Do you like / green eggs and ham?  
`Colbawe wibalwe-li veskepi / somadezun na?`  

---

I do not like them, Sam-I-am.  
`Zamu-wm-zat, somadeyumun.`  
I do not like green eggs and ham.  
`Colbawe wibalwe-li veskepi somadeyumun.`

---

Would you like them / here or there?  
`Tihan-vos alhan fel somadezun na?`  
(`-vos` = inclusive or; `fel som-(ad-ez)-un` = `HYP please-3pS-2O`, would you like them)

---

I would not like them / here or there. / I would not like them anywhere.  
`Tihan-vos alhan fel somadeyumun. Velhan fel somadeyumun.`

I do not like green eggs and ham. / I do not like them, Sam-I-am.  
`Colbawe wibalwe-li veskepi somadeyumun. Zamu-wm-zat, somadeyumun.`

---

Would you like them in a house? Would you like them with a mouse?  
`Rali henqo ad fel somadezun na? Balri wli ad fel somadezun na?`  
(In this case the prepositional phrases seem to be able the GE&H. That is, the GE&H are in a house or with a mouse, rather than the liking being done in a house etc. Therefore I've used adjectival `henqo` rather than adverbial `henqos`.)

---

I do not like them in a house. / I do not like them with a mouse.  
`Rali henqo ad somadeyumun. / Balri wli ad somadeyumun.`  
(Note that the speaker drops the hypothetical in his phrasing.)

I do not like them here or there. / I do not like them anywhere.  
`Tihan-vos alhan fel somadeyumun. / Velhan fel somadeyumun.`

I do not like green eggs and ham. / I do not like them, Sam-I-am.  
`Colbawe wibalwe-li veskepi somadeyumun. / Zamu-wm-zat, somadeyumun.`

---

Would you eat them in a box? / Would you eat them with a fox?  
`Oca henqo ad fel wlizodoc na? / Qerwkse wli ad fel wlizodoc na?`  

---

Not in a box. / Not with a fox. / Not in a house. / Not with a mouse.  
`Oca henqo, xa. / Qerwkse wli, xa. / Rali henqo, xa. / Balri wli, xa.`  
I would not eat them / here or there. / I would not eat them anywhere.  
`Tihan-vos alhan fel wlwmeyodoc. / Velhan fel wlwmeyodoc.`  
I would not eat green eggs and ham.  
`Colbawe wibalwe-li veskepi fel wlwmeyodoc.`  
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.  
`Zamu-wm-zat, somadeyumun.`

Would you? Could you? In a car?  
`Fel iz na? Fel merizin na? Xotilu henqos na?`  
Eat them! Eat them! Here they are.  
`'wlodoc! 'wlodoc! Tihan jadif.`  
(Possible to drop the second `fel` for meter? (i.e. "Can you?") Use `'wlizodoc!` for the impolite imperative, because Jesus Christ Sam-I-am.)

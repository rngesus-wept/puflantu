Map of Antarctica with an X and a curvy compass-rose that's off-center so that the directions are still clear. Could use gimp or something for this.

Arrows with text pointing in these directions:

Fu  North
Ka  South
Qi  East
No  West

A single sentence saying "Camp located Northwest of X" so that northwest vs westnorth can be properly distinguished.

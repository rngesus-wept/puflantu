Little boxes on the hillside,  
Little boxes made of ticky tacky  
Little boxes on the hillside,  
Little boxes all the same,  
There's a pink one and a green one  
And a blue one and a yellow one  
And they're all made out of ticky tacky  
And they all look just the same.

And the people in the houses  
All went to the university  
Where they were put in boxes  
And they came out all the same  
And there's doctors and lawyers  
And business executives  
And they're all made out of ticky tacky  
And they all look just the same.  

And they all play on the golf course  
And drink their martinis dry  
And they all have pretty children  
And the children go to school,  
And the children go to summer camp  
And then to the university  
Where they are put in boxes  
And they come out all the same.

And the boys go into business  
And marry and raise a family  
In boxes made of ticky tacky  
And they all look just the same,  
There's a pink one and a green one  
And a blue one and a yellow one  
And they're all made out of ticky tacky  
And they all look just the same.

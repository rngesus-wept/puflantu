I met a traveller from an antique land
old-AUG  land-ELA  traveller  meet-1S-PST

He said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
say-RS-PST:  large-AUG-DU-&   body-??-DU  stone-???  leg-DU
Im tacatwl:  agogw       -li

Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
desert-INE stand-3S. them-ALL, sand-ADE,

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies. Its frown
half sink-RO-& shatter-RO-DEP visage lie-3S, R-GEN frown-&

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
wrinkle-3rO-DEP lip-& cold command-GER sneer

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read.
tell-3pS read-3S-PST-DEP

They yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things -
survive-rS-IMP, this-PL lifeless-ADE stamp-rO-DEP.

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.

And on the pedestal these words appear:
MY NAME IS OZYMANDIAS, KING OF KINGS.
LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

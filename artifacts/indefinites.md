*This is a table of indefinite pronouns in Perflontus, for things like this, that,
this-place (i.e. "here"), that-place (i.e. "there"), what-reason (i.e. "why"), and so forth.
The main takeaway intended for the solvers is the structure of the grid, so that it's a little
clearer that the meaning of `tihan` can be inferred from the meaning of `alhan` and `ita` (which
are both more commonly used in our artifacts).*

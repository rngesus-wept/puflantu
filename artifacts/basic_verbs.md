# Verbs

This artifact contains a series of images with captions written in puflontu. Groups of captions share common verbs, but with differing person and number for the subjects and objects. The main goal of this artifact is to teach people how to infix verbs with subject pronouns, object pronouns, and the negation infix. We want to have enough groups of verbs and examples within those groups so that people can piece together those systems. 

If in addition, this artifact gives puzzlers experience with tense, degree modification, and verb derived nouns/adjectives, that's great. But that's not the primary goal, and I'm imagining that these features of verbs will be left to other artifacts.  

Here are some examples. The more person/number examples we have for subject and object, the better. Some negations of the verb (e.g. love -> not love, rather than love -> hate) would be great too.

# Notes

* I am currently choosing to translate "breakfast" as "first bread", but that implies bread as some kind of staple food for the aliens. Will have to think on this a bit more. "Breakfast" frequently has some obvious etymology in human languages:
  * Chinese: Early meal
  * Japanese: Morning rice
  * Spanish: dis-fast
  * Russian: during morning +k
* Many human languages seem to import metric units phonetically, with Chinese being a notable exception.
* Many human languages use their existing word for "cup".
* The Perflontus numbering system uses base 6.
* Measured units of things are expressed as $THING $NUMBER $UNIT. In particular $THING is taken as an adjective for $UNIT, and therefore the applied noun class is based on $UNIT rather than $THING.
* Need differentiation between "Use this to do X" and "Use this by doing X".

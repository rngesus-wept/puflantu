# Notes

  * Entry 2 features an incorrect participle for "My heart is broke"; Perflontus
    uses `juyolun` instead of `juyolun-ka`.
  * Entry 3 features an instance of "to see" replaced by "five". This is done by
    trying to conjugate "five-RO-DEP" `nole-ka` instead of a direct translation
    of "five".

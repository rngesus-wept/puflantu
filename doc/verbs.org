*** Basic Inflections

Verbs have a root form which is inflected in various ways. In particular, the
root form of a verb is not a valid word unto itself. The most common way a verb
is inflected is to indicate its subject, object, and negation. This is done
through the use of infixes. The point at which a verb accepts infixes is always
immediately before its final vowel. To help in remembering this, the root form a
verb is always written with an asterisk indicating this position.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
wl*oc    "to eat"
wlwmoc   eat-1S "I eat"
wlizoc   eat-2S "you eat"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each verb accepts up to three infixes, in the following order:

  * A subject pronoun, as described above. This is always present in the active
    voice, even if the subject is explicitly named elsewhere in the sentence.
    (It may be absent in cases where the verb form is used to derive a noun, or
    when using the passive voice.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Andursun  ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
Anderson  one  cookie  eat-3S.
Anderson eats a cookie.

Ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
One  cookie  eat-3S.
He eats a cookie.

Andursun ke toreli *wloc. -- Incorrect, [at] infix must still be provided.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

  * A negation infix ~ey~. This indicates the negation/lack of the action, /not/ a
    reversal of the action. The corresponding distinction can be seen in English
    where "to not do" something is distinct from "to undo" it; this is the
    former.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Canik    kofuri  ratiq.
Yannick  coffee  drink-3S.
Yannick drinks coffee.

Canik    enxura  rat[ey]iq.
Yannick  water   drink-3S-NEG.
Yannick does not drink water.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

  * An object pronoun, as described above. This is present to the degree that
    it needs to be for disambiguation:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Dani   qek[wm]ad.
Danny  meet-1S.
I meet Danny.

Qek[wm][ot]ad.
Meet-1S-3O.
I meet him.

Dani   qek[wm][ot]ad. -- Valid with redundant 3O infix; may indicate emphasis.
Danny  meet-1S-3O.
I meet *Danny*.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

    * It is also present /without the subject pronoun/ when using the passive voice:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Torelwe    wlodoc.
Cookie-PL  eat-3pO
Cookies were eaten.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

      Note that many English words also overlap their transitive and
      intransitive forms -- for example, compare "I boil the water" and "The
      water boils". In Perflontus, when using the intransitive form of the verb,
      the phrasing is identical to using the passive voice with the transitive
      verb; the latter example can be thought of as "The water is boiled".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Enxura   lirwmwb.
water-R  boil-1S
I boil the water.

Enxura   libotwb.
water-R  boil-3O
The water boils / The water is boiled.
```

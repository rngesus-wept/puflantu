*** Basic Inflections

Verbs have a root form which is inflected in various ways. In particular, the
root form of a verb is not a valid word unto itself. The most common way a verb
is inflected is to indicate its subject, object, and negation. This is done
through the use of infixes. The point at which a verb accepts infixes is always
immediately before its final vowel. To help in remembering this, the root form a
verb is always written with an asterisk indicating this position.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
wl*oc    "to eat"
wlwmoc   eat-1S "I eat"
wlizoc   eat-2S "you eat"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each verb accepts up to three infixes, in the following order:

  * A subject pronoun, as described above. This is always present in the active
    voice, even if the subject is explicitly named elsewhere in the sentence.
    (It may be absent in cases where the verb form is used to derive a noun, or
    when using the passive voice.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Andursun  ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
Anderson  one  cookie  eat-3S.
Anderson eats a cookie.

Ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
One  cookie  eat-3S.
He eats a cookie.

Andursun ke toreli *wloc. -- Incorrect, [at] infix must still be provided.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

  * A negation infix ~ey~. This indicates the negation/lack of the action, /not/ a
    reversal of the action. The corresponding distinction can be seen in English
    where "to not do" something is distinct from "to undo" it; this is the
    former.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Canik    kofuri  ratiq.
Yannick  coffee  drink-3S.
Yannick drinks coffee.

Canik    enxura  rat[ey]iq.
Yannick  water   drink-3S-NEG.
Yannick does not drink water.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

  * An object pronoun, as described above. This is present to the degree that
    it needs to be for disambiguation:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Dani   qek[wm]ad.
Danny  meet-1S.
I meet Danny.

Qek[wm][ot]ad.
Meet-1S-3O.
I meet him.

Dani   qek[wm][ot]ad. -- Valid with redundant 3O infix; may indicate emphasis.
Danny  meet-1S-3O.
I meet *Danny*.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

    * It is also present /without the subject pronoun/ when using the passive voice:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Torelwe    wlodoc.
Cookie-PL  eat-3pO
Cookies were eaten.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

      Note that many English words also overlap their transitive and
      intransitive forms -- for example, compare "I boil the water" and "The
      water boils". In Perflontus, when using the intransitive form of the verb,
      the phrasing is identical to using the passive voice with the transitive
      verb; the latter example can be thought of as "The water is boiled".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
```
Enxura   lirwmwb.
water-R  boil-1S
I boil the water.

Enxura   libotwb.
water-R  boil-3O
The water boils / The water is boiled.
```
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Tense, Aspect, and Mood

Perflontus expresses two non-present tenses, past and future; two aspects,
imperfect and perfect; and two irrealis moods, the hypothetical and the
counterfactual. (Briefly, the imperfect aspect indicates that the verb action is
ongoing or otherwise incomplete; the perfect aspect indicates that the verb
action has concluded.) These expressions appear as proclitics, i.e. prefix
particles.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Present              | --  | Elaiza zumatuz.       | Eliza sleeps.                        |
| Past (PST)           | im  | Elaiza im zumatuz.    | Eliza slept.                         |
| Future (FUT)         | et  | Elaiza et zumatuz.    | Eliza will sleep.                    |
|----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Imperfect (IMP)      | av  | Elaiza av zumatuz.    | Eliza is sleeping.                   |
|                      |     | Elaiza imav zumatuz.  | Eliza was sleeping.                  |
|                      |     | Elaiza etav zumatuz.  | Eliza will be sleeping.              |
|----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Perfect (PRF)        | os  | Elaiza os zumatuz.    | Eliza has slept.                     |
|                      |     | Elaiza imos zumatuz.  | Eliza had slept.                     |
|                      |     | Elaiza etos zumatuz.  | Eliza will have slept.               |
|----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Hypothetical (HYP)   | fel | Elaiza fel zumatuz.   | Eliza might sleep.                   |
|                      |     | Elaiza avfel zumatuz. | Eliza might be sleeping.             |
|                      |     | Elaiza imfel zumatuz. | Eliza might have slept.              |
|----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Counterfactual (CFT) | gaq | Elaiza gaq zumatuz.   | Eliza would sleep (but isn't).       |
|                      |     | Elaiza avgaq zumatuz. | Eliza would be sleeping (but isn't). |
|                      |     | Elaiza imgaq zumatuz. | Eliza would have slept (but didn't). |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Verbs may be modified in degree or even reversed by the use of a prefix:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
|                    | Alpoxe horwmod.   | I remember that time.             |
| Diminutive (DIM)   | Alpoxe yihorwmod. | I remember that time (a bit).     |
| Augmentative (AUG) | Alpoxe aghorwmod. | I remember that time (intensely). |
| Reverse (REV)      | Alpoxe vohorwmod. | I forget that time.               |
#+END_EXAMPLE

If multiple prefixes are used, DIM/AUG come before REV, i.e. ~yivohor*od~, not
~voyihor*od~.

*** To Be

Perflontus has only one irregular verb, the copula ~az~ "to be". When inflected as
a main verb, ~az~ is inflected as ~z*~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| z[wm] | z[at] | z[ad]    | z[at][ey] |
| I am  | It is | They are | It is not |
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is possible for ~az~ to take an object "infix" in this form, e.g. ~zateyot~ "It
is not it", but it's unclear whether this is formally correct. A good example of
this issue is the use of "It is I" vs "It is me" in English, which raises
questions of whether the things linked by the copula should both have subjective
case and so forth. In other words, the use of ~az~ in these cases is undecided,
but the above object-free examples should be enough to get you through a lot of
use cases.

~az~ is only "to be" in the strictly copular sense, i.e. one that expresses some
sort of identity relation. Separate verbs are used for other meanings that have
been folded into the English "to be", e.g. ~z*if~ "to be located", ~j*if~ "to
exist".

=Az= copies the number inflections from the things it links, as well as the
negative inflection of adjectives (but not nouns). This mirroring is primarily
seen for =az= but also occurs for other verbs that express some notion of
identity, e.g. =etaz= "to become".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Didi  ruzeqo  zat.
Didi  hunger  be-3S.
Didi is hungry.

Didi  ruzeq[ay]o  zat[ey].
Didi  hunger-NEG  be-3S-NEG.
Didi is not hungry.

Didi  ruzeq[ay]o  zat.
Didi  hunger-NEG  be-3S.
Didi is a not-hungry (person).

Didi-li  Joxu  ruzeq[w]   z[ab].
Didi-&   Josh  hunger-DU  be-3dS.
Didi and Josh are hungry.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Imperatives and Instructions

The imperative voice is indicated by prefixing the active verb with ~'~. The most
polite forms, as might be used by a manual, inflect the verb as though using the
passive voice, i.e. omitting the "you" subject. Direct, more "blunt" forms
address, add the subject pronoun infixes.

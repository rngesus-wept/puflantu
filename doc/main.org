* General Language Elements

Spelling is directly mapped onto pronunciation, which generally follows the
rules you'd expect for some kind of Romanized hybrid of Mandarin and Japanese.

Word order in Perflontus (Perflontus "/Puflantu/") is Subject-Object-Verb. Unlike
many natural SOV languages, there are no particle markers for subject and
object, so word order is somewhat more constrained.

Nouns and adjectives always end in vowels; in addition, the boundaries between
these two parts of speech are rather fluid, and many words that function as one
also function as the other. Verbs and adverbs always end in consonants (though
the definition of "adverb" is somewhat loose). Verbs have a root form which is
never used directly; instead, a large body of affixes is used to inflect the
root form with syntactic and semantic meaning.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alisu  Puflantu    catub.
Alice  Perflontus  speak-she.
Alice speaks Perflontus.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Descriptors are generally prepositive, i.e. they come before the things they
describe. Conversely, things that appear in English as prepositions generally
appear as /post/-positions in Perflontus. To put it another way, Perflontus is
strongly head-final, meaning that the word that defines the type of phrase it's
in comes at the end of the phrase.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Honwze  jozrwpo  entuyice  tis     im   kanwmwj.
blue    shirt    store     at-ADV  PST  buy-1S
I bought a blue shirt at the store.
#+END_EXAMPLE

(Note that because of noun/adjective duality and the lack of markers, it is up
to the listener to determine that the speaker does not intend something like ~I
bought a blue (thing) at the shirt store~ or ~I bought (the color/concept) blue at
the shirt store~.)

* Notation

Throughout this documentation, examples will include glosses in English to help
convey Perflontic grammar without requiring vocabulary knowledge from the reader.
Because of the nature of Perflontic inflection, we use a large body of short tags
to indicate how a thing is being inflected, as follows:

  * Personal pronouns are indicated by their person and their case, with their
    number indicated in lowercase if they are not singular. Some examples:
    * 1S = first person (singular) subject = "I"
    * 2dO = second person dual object = "you two"
    * 3pO = third person plural object = "them"
    * RS = relative pronoun, subject case (this frequently appears as "that" in
      English; these pronouns are only used in [[file:clauses.org][dependent clauses]] to indicate the
      role of "that" within the clause, if it has one)
  * Verbs are infixed by personal pronouns, abbreviated as above. In addition:
    * NEG = negated (drink-1S-NEG = I do not drink)
    * REV = reversed (remember-3S-REV = He forgets)
    * AUG = augmentative (cook-2S-AUG = You overcook)
    * DIM = diminutive (look-1S-DIM = I peek)
    * DEP = this verb is the main verb of a dependent clause
    * IMP = imperative (card draw-3O-IMP = Draw a card)
    * 2S-IMP = impolite imperative (leave-2S-IMP = Leave!)
  * Verbs can be turned into noun/adjectives in the following ways:
    * GER = gerund OR present participle (sleep-GER = sleeping, sleep-GER man = sleeping man, relax-GER = relaxation)
    * INS = instrumental (sleep-INS clothes = sleeping clothes)
    * AGT = agent, thing that X-es (drink-AGT = drinker)
    * PAT = patient, thing that is X'd or can be X'd (drink-PAT = potable)
    * LOC = locative, X-hosting (eat-LOC room = dining room)
    * CAU = causative, X-causing (eat-CAU medicine = appetite stimulant)
    * RES = resultative, resulting from X (mix-RES = mixture)
  * Nounjectives take the following affixes:
    * DU = dual number (lemon-DU = pair of lemons)
    * PL = plural number (lemon-PL = lemons)
    * NEG = negation (blue-NEG = not blue)
    * CMP = comparative (loud-CMP = louder)
    * SUP = superlative (loud-SUP = loudest)
    * ADV = adverb (loud-ADV = loudly) -- note that *not all adverbs use this, only the ones formed from nounjectives*

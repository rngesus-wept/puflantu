*** Number and Negation

  Perflontic nouns always have at least two syllables (which is to say, vowels)
  and always end in a vowel other than ~w~. In their noun form, they don't take any
  interesting inflections other than for number. When a noun is given the dual
  number its final vowel is replaced by ~w~. For the plural number, it is replaced
  by ~we~. Zero is considered to be part of the plural number.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Furedu  toreli  wlatoc.
  Fred    cookie  eat-3S.
  Fred eats (a) cookie.

  Ha   torelw     wlatoc.
  Two  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
  He eats two cookies.

  Hasa   pagke  torelwe    wlatoc.
  2*216  25     cookie-PL  eat-3S.
  He eats 461 cookies.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Nouns also function as adjectives with no additional inflection. Some root forms
  are translated as one part of speech or the other in English, but the parts of
  speech in Perflontus should be understood as interchangeable as appropriate.

  Adjectives take on the numeric inflection of the nouns they modify. In addition,
  adjectives may be negated by infixing ~-ay-~ before their final vowel.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Jekobu  kolbao  toreli  wlatoc.
  Jakob   green   cookie  eat-3S.
  Jakob eats (a) green cookie.

  Jekobu  ha   kolbaw    torelw     wlatoc.
  Jakob   two  green-DU  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
  Jakob eats two green cookies.

  Jekobu  kolba[ay]we   torelwe    wlateyoc.
  Jakob   green-NEG-PL  cookie-DU  eat-3S-NEG.
  Jakob does not eat non-green cookies.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Note that numbers (like ~ha~ "two" in the second example) are an exception to
  this. They do not generally take on the same inflections as the objects they
  count (including inflection due to negation or noun class), but might still be
  pluralized in cases where they are used as estimation units (e.g. ~yo torelwe~ "36
  cookies" vs ~ywe torelwe~ "36s of cookies").

*** Verb-Derived Nouns and Adjectives

Verbs may be suffixed to form nouns. These suffixes are applied to the root form
of the verb, including ~az~. They are compatible with all the affixes described
previously, except for the pronoun infixes. The resulting noun/adjective is
considered a root form unto itself, so that inflections like ~-ay-~ that target
the final vowel of the word apply to the final vowel of the verb+suffix, not the
final vowel of the root verb.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Suffix type      | Noun sense                  | Adjective sense         | Suffix | Example              |
|------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------+--------+----------------------|
| Gerund (GER)     | The act of X-ing            | In the process of X-ing | -a     | daxa "teaching"      |
| Agent (AGT)      | A thing that X's            | Capable of X-ing        | -afe   | daxafe "teacher"     |
| Patient (PAT)    | A thing that is X'd         | X-able                  | -who   | daxwho "student"     |
| Instrument (INS) | A thing that enables X-ing  | X-assisting, for X-ing  | -aqo   | daxaqo "educational" |
| Location (LOC)   | A place where X-ing happens | X-hosting               | -ice   | daxice               |
| Cause (CAU)      | A thing that causes X-ing   | X-causing               | -ede   | daxede               |
| Result (RES)     | A thing that results from X | X-produced              | -oda   | daxoda               |
#+END_EXAMPLE

It should be noted that the use of these suffixes should be taken very
literally, which is one of the reasons that many suffixes will not have a clean
gloss into English. For example, it may be tempting to gloss ~daxice~
"teach-location" as "school" but you could just as easily interpret that as
"classroom". The best you can really do is just substitute "teaching-place"
where it appears to avoid carrying in any unmerited assumptions. Thus to specify
"school" you might have to say ~daxice veonxi~ "teaching-place building" as
opposed to ~daxice jiso~ "teaching-place room". Of course, Perflontus should
ultimately have root words for "school" and "classroom" directly.

***** Gerund Case ~-a~

The gerund case of a verb is a derived noun meaning that verb's action. Some
uses of the infinitive in various languages also perform this role; in
Perflontus the two both use the gerund case.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Zumuz[a]   Qarluz   somatun.
sleep-GER  Charles  please-3S.
Sleeping/to sleep pleases Charles. (Charles likes sleeping/to sleep.)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When used as an adjective this case always functions as a present participle,
and only with the connotation of a thing that is performing the action in
question. In particular, when describing something that is used /for/ an action
rather than something that is performing the action itself, use the [[Instrumental Case ~-aqo~][instrumental
case]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Qarluz   eqa   zumuza     hie    zat.
Charles  that  sleep-GER  human  be-3S.
Charles is the sleeping person.

*Zumuza     kworu    kworatem.  -- Incorrect, the clothes are *for* sleeping
*sleep-GER  clothes  wear-3S
He wears clothes that are sleeping.  -- unless the clothes are alive???

Zumuzaqo   kworu    kworatem.
sleep-INS  clothes  wear-3S
He wears clothes that are for sleeping.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Also, be careful with present participial form of intransitive verbs. For
example, in English, "boiling water" refers to water that is boiling, not water
that is boiling something else. As noted in [[Verbs, Part 1 -- Basic Infixes][Basic Infixes]], a "passive voice"
style of inflection is required here. A full treatment of other participial
forms is covered in [[Dependent Clauses (STUB)][Dependent Clauses]].

The resulting word acts as a root form; in particular, additional
transformations that would be applied to a noun apply to the suffixed verb as a
whole. It is still possible to apply some affixes to the verbal root before the
suffix, which may create subtly different meanings.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Qarluz   eqa   zumuzaya       hie    zat.
Charles  that  sleep-GER-NEG  human  be-3P.
Charles is the person who is not sleeping.

Qarluz   eqa   zumeyuza       hie    zat.
Charles  that  sleep-NEG-GER  human  be-3P.
Charles is the person who is (not-sleep)ing.  -- connotations of forced wakefulness, perhaps
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Agent Case ~-afe~ and Patient Case ~-who~

The agent case of a verb is a derived noun referring to an entity that is taking
the action or is capable of taking the action. In English this functions much
like the "-er" suffix for verbs.

In the adjective form the derived word strictly denotes capability. To refer to
an entity that is currently taking the action, use the Gerund case instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Maksu  hinalafe   zat.
Max    dance-AGT  be-3P.
Max is a dancer / Max is dance-capable.  -- context required to disambiguate

Maksu  hinalafe   hie    zat.
Max    dance-AGT  human  be-3P.
Max is a dance-capable person.  -- example of grammatical disambiguation

Maksu  hinalafaye     zatey.
Max    dance-AGT-NEG  be-3P-NEG.
Max is not a dancer / Max is not dance-capable.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Conversely the patient case refers to something that is the target of the
suffixed action, or capable of being such. In English the "-ee" suffix might be
used in the noun form. For the adjective form reasonable translations are
"X-able" or "for X-ing" (as an object). ("For X-ing" as a subject falls under
the instrumental case.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Eqwe     torelwe    wlocwho  zad.
That-PL  cookie-PL  eat-PAT  be-3pS.
Those cookies are for eating / edible / to be eaten.

Equra   enxura   riqwhurayo       zatey.
That-R  water-R  drink-PAT-NEG-R  be-3S-NEG.
That water is not for drinking.
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Instrumental Case ~-aqo~

The instrumental case of a verb refers to something that is used for the action
in question. This is slightly different from something that /causes/ the action in
question.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Burainu  daxaqo     kude  gaten.
Brian    teach-INS  book  read-3S.
Brian reads a textbook.

Burainu  sinqeraqo     kude  gaten.
Brian    describe-INS  book  read-3S.
Brian reads a manual.

Burainu  uqilwe  yelaqwe  moratuh.
Brian    several-PL  learn-INS  own-3S.
Brian has several things used for learning.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that this is more a descriptive term than anything else and should not be
used to generate specific words, primarily because many different things can be
instrumental for an action. For example a spoon can be ~wlocaqo~ "eat-instrument",
but so can a fork, a bowl, or a person's mouth. So it would be inappropriate to
use ~wlocaqo~ as a word that means specifically "spoon", unless there's other
nearby context that disambiguates it.

***** Locative Case ~-ice~ (STUB)
***** Causative Case ~-ede~ (STUB)
***** Resultative Case =-oda= (STUB)

*** Possessives

For nouns, the possessive case is marked simply by suffixing =-ro=. This
possessive form works as both a noun and an adjective.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alanu-ro  kude  emkixa  zat.
Alan-GEN  book  red     be-3S.
Alan's book is red.

Robu-ro  honwze  zat.
Rob-GEN  blue    be-3S.
Rob's is blue.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that there are two potential points for numeric inflection here: The root
noun is inflected to indicate the number of possessors, while the =-ro= suffix may
be inflected to indicate the number of possessed objects.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Justiinu-rwe    kudwe    kolbawe   zad.
Justine-GEN-PL  book-PL  green-PL  be-3pS.
Justine's books are green.

Yelafwe-ro        kude  wre    zat.
Learn-AGT-PL-GEN  book  black  be-3S.
The students' book is black.

Yelafwe-rwe          kworwe       apwe      zad.
Learn-AGT-PL-GEN-PL  clothing-PL  white-PL  be-3pS
The students' clothes are white.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Possessive pronouns are formed by infixing the /subject/ form of the pronoun into
=r*o=. This applies to all personal pronouns, their interrogative forms (=wat= et
al, described in more detail later), and to =ita= "this" and =iqa= "that". As with
regular nouns, it is important to pay attention to the difference in inflection
for the number of possessors vs the number of possessed things.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Itwe     torelwe    rwmwe     zad.
this-PL  cookie-PL  1-GEN-PL  be-3pS.
These cookies are mine.

Iqa   toreli  rixe    zat.
that  cookie  2p-GEN  be-3S.
That cookie is y'all's.

Rwatwe      zad    na.
Who-GEN-PL  be-3S  ?
Whose are those?

*** Number and Negation

  Perflontic nouns always have at least two syllables (which is to say, vowels)
  and always end in a vowel other than ~w~. In their noun form, they don't take any
  interesting inflections other than for number. When a noun is given the dual
  number its final vowel is replaced by ~w~. For the plural number, it is replaced
  by ~we~. Zero is considered to be part of the plural number.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Furedu  toreli  wlatoc.
  Fred    cookie  eat-3S.
  Fred eats (a) cookie.

  Ha   torelw     wlatoc.
  Two  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
  He eats two cookies.

  Hasa   pagke  torelwe    wlatoc.
  2*216  25     cookie-PL  eat-3S.
  He eats 461 cookies.

  Nouns also function as adjectives with no additional inflection. Some root forms
  are translated as one part of speech or the other in English, but the parts of
  speech in Perflontus should be understood as interchangeable as appropriate.

  Adjectives take on the numeric inflection of the nouns they modify. In addition,
  adjectives may be negated by infixing ~-ay-~ before their final vowel.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Jekobu  kolbao  toreli  wlatoc.
  Jakob   green   cookie  eat-3S.
  Jakob eats (a) green cookie.

  Jekobu  ha   kolbaw    torelw     wlatoc.
  Jakob   two  green-DU  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
  Jakob eats two green cookies.

  Jekobu  kolba[ay]we   torelwe    wlateyoc.
  Jakob   green-NEG-PL  cookie-DU  eat-3S-NEG.
  Jakob does not eat non-green cookies.

  Note that numbers (like ~ha~ "two" in the second example) are an exception to
  this. They do not generally take on the same inflections as the objects they
  count (including inflection due to negation or noun class), but might still be
  pluralized in cases where they are used as estimation units (e.g. ~yo torelwe~ "36
  cookies" vs ~ywe torelwe~ "36s of cookies").

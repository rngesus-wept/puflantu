#+TITLE: The Sounds of Perflontus

Perflontus consists of 27 phonemes, which are mapped onto the English alphabet
plus apostrophe ='=. Roughly speaking, most of the vowels behave like you'd expect
from Spanish or Japanese, and most of the consonants behave like you'd expect
from English or romanized Mandarin. The exceptions, briefly, are:

  * ~w~ is the "oo" sound; ~u~ is "uh".
  * ~g~ and ~y~ should be pronounced as though there's an "n" preceding them.
  * ~c~ is "zh".
  * ~'~ is the sound of a bell.

The table below gives an exact breakdown.

*** Syllabification

Syllables in Perflontus always contain exactly one vowel, which may be preceded
by at most one consonant, and followed by at most one consonant. This means that
an English speaker must take care to pronounce vowel and consonant clusters as
though they contain a syllable break, even if the cluster would represent a
valid English diphthong. For example ~wfro~ should be pronounced as ~OOF-roh~ and
not ~OO-froh~; and ~riqwe~ as ~REE-choo-ay~ and not ~REACH-way~ or ~REE-chway~. When in
doubt a consonant belongs to the same syllable as the vowel following it, e.g.
~i-qa~ not ~iq-a~.

Stress occurs on the syllable preceding a word's final consonant, not counting
any particles. Thus for verbs the stress will fall on the final syllable; for
nouns, usually on the penultimate or antepenultimate. (If there is no such
syllable, the first syllable is stressed).

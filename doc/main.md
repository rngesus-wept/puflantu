# Language TODOs

-   [ ] Fill out the lexicon
    -   [ ] Common verbs - to have (possess), to need, to want, to must (obligatory)
    -   [ ] Common "particles" - on, from, positions
    -   [ ] Mother, father, parent, child, other familial relations
    -   [ ] Same, different
    -   [ ] Elements of the periodic table
        -   There are some interesting etymological choices to be made here. For
            example, in human languages, many of the smaller atoms are named for
            their most common occurrences, whereas many of the larger ones are named
            for their discoverers (as people or as institutions).
-   [ ] Reflexive constructions &#x2013; easiest way is probably just to create
    another class of pronouns. In particular, because the pronoun infix always
    precedes a vowel, you can do something like add `-b` to the end of the
    existing pronoun and specify that the special reflexive pronoun never occurs
    as a word on its own. Thus `Dwmax.` "I teach" can be `Dwmbax.` "I teach myself."
    (But probably not exactly `-b`; "I teach myself" is getting a little
    phonetically close to "Dumbass" there.)
-   [ ] Appositives
-   [ ] Addressing the listener
-   [ ] Adpositions or equivalent &#x2013; Note that many human languages use these
    cases in ways that only overlap via locational metaphor, e.g. when
    describing *temporal* location like in "in five minutes"; and the mapping is
    not consistent across languages.
    -   Inessive (INE) &#x2013; "in" or "located at"
    -   Elative (ELA) &#x2013; "out of"
    -   Illative (ILL) &#x2013; "into" (contrast inessive, which does not have
        directional connotations)
    -   Adessive (ADE) &#x2013; "on"
    -   Ablative (ABL) &#x2013; "away from" (this one is more commonly mentioned / has
        more WP elaboration than the others; is it somehow more important?)
    -   Allative (ALL) &#x2013; "toward"
    -   Superessive (SUPE) &#x2013; "upon"
-   [ ] Use of `ag-` and `yi-` as intensifier and downtoner respectively should be
    extended to adjectives, even if they aren't verb-derived.
-   [ ] Take a moment to consider whether we have inadvertently created words
    that are deeply taboo, spoken or written, in English and whatever other
    languages we can think to check. Is there a good way to automate this check?
-   [ ] Actually write the section on adverbial suffixing
-   [ ] Perflontus speakers use an inner/outer spatial metaphor for time (where
    most human languages use front/forward/behind/back styles of metaphor). The
    inner direction corresponds to the past.
-   [ ] Likely need a past participial adjective for smoothness?

# How to *Puflantu*


<a id="orgee1d38a"></a>

## General Language Elements

Spelling is directly mapped onto pronunciation, which generally follows the
rules you'd expect for some kind of Romanized hybrid of Mandarin and Japanese.

Word order in Perflontus (Perflontus "*Puflantu*") is Subject-Object-Verb. Nouns
and adjectives always end in vowels. Verbs and adverbs always end in consonants.

    Alisu  Puflantu    catub.
    Alice  Perflontus  speak-she.

Descriptors are generally prepositive, i.e. they come before the things they
describe. In general Perflontus is head-final, meaning that the word that
defines the type of phrase it's in comes at the end of the phrase.


<a id="org97cc7d8"></a>

## Sounds

Perflontus consists of 27 phonemes, which are mapped onto the English alphabet
plus apostrophe `'`.


<a id="orgaeb85bd"></a>

### Vowels

It has six vowels: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, and `w`. The first four are pronounced as they
are in Spanish or Japanese; in English these vowels appear in "car", "bait",
"feat", and "goat" respectively.

`u` is pronounced as a schwa <ə>, which appears with some frequency in English
depending on how slack the speaker is in their unstressed syllables. Examples
are the "i" in "pencil", the "e" in "camera", or the second "o" in "chocolate".
<ʌ>, as in "butt", is a reasonable allophone.

`w` is pronounced as <u>, the "oo" sound you'd expect `u` to make but it doesn't.
"Goon" and "pool" are good English examples.


<a id="orgaa29b27"></a>

### Consonants

Of the consonants, `b`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `p`, `r`, `s`, `t`, and `z` behave the way a
native English speaker would expect.

`f` and `v` are close to normal for English but are actually mapped to <ɸ> and
<β> respectively, which are pronounced without using one's teeth. The "f" and
"v" in Japanese and Spanish are supposed to actually use these if you're not a
gaijin/gringo. English speakers will perceive that they are blowing more air
than usual when pronouncing these.

`y` and `g` are <ɲ> and <ŋ> respectively; a reasonable shortcut for an English
speaker is to imagine a preceding "n" whenever these letters are encountered.
Italian and Spanish use "gn" and "ñ" respectively for <ɲ>. English "ng" is a
correct interpretation of <ŋ> but the phoneme will show up a lot more often
and in "unusual" places. For physiological reasons whenever two of `g`, `n`, and `y`
appear adjacent to one another the first is pronounced as <n> regardless of
the actual spelling used.

`q` and `x` are <tʃ> "ch" and <ʃ> "sh" respectively, corresponding to their use
in romanized Chinese.

`c` is <ʒ>, the second half of the "j" phoneme. In English it appears as the "s"
in "leisure", the "g" in "concierge", or the second half of the "x" in "luxury".

`h` is <x>, which is like English "h" but uses the back of the throat more. It's
all over the place in Hebrew/Yiddish, and its English usage is predominantly
in loan words from those language like the "ch" in "chutzpah". It is not quite
as rough as Klingon "H", because we aren't quite that deep into sci-fi tropes.

Finally, `'` is the sound of a bell. When pronouncing this as a human it is
sufficient to use a glottal stop instead &#x2013; that's the slight pause and buildup
of air that comes just before a lot of word-initial vowels in English. In
particular it happens just before both vowels in "uh-oh". For our audio work we
will overlay a bell sound on top of these pauses, so maybe draw them out a
little?


<a id="orga321042"></a>

### Syllables

Syllables in Perflontus always contain exactly one vowel, which may be preceded
by at most one consonant, and followed by at most one consonant. This means that
an English speaker must take care to pronounce vowel and consonant clusters as
though they contain a syllable break, even if the cluster would represent a
valid English diphthong. For example `wfro` should be pronounced as `OOF-roh` and
not `OO-froh`; and `riqwe` as `REE-choo-ay` and not `REACH-way` or `REE-chway`. When in
doubt a consonant belongs to the same syllable as the vowel following it, e.g.
`i-qa` not `iq-a`.

Stress occurs on the syllable preceding a word's final consonant, not counting
any particles. Thus for verbs the stress will fall on the final syllable; for
nouns, usually on the penultimate or antepenultimate.

    A- la- nu   Puf- lan- tu   ca-  tub.
    ah-LAH-nuh  puff-LAHN-tuh  zhah-TUB.

    Bu- nu   pa- i   to- re- lw- a   im   w- la- toc.
    BUH-nuh  PAH-ee  toh-RAY-loo-ah  EEM  oo-lah-TOZH.


<a id="org400ff8c"></a>

## Pronouns, Part 1 &#x2013; Personal Pronouns

Pronouns play a core role in Perflontic inflection, and therefore must be
addressed first. Perflontic pronouns have the following characteristics:

-   First/second/third person designations.
-   Subject/object designations. Formally the subject form is the nominative
    case, while the object form covers the oblique case, a.k.a. "everything
    else". (This is the same casing system English uses.)
-   Singular/dual/plural designations. The dual number refers specifically to
    two of a thing; thus separate pronouns are used to refer to "you, alone",
    "the two of you", and "y'all".
-   No gender distinctions, including for third person personals.
-   No sentience distinctions, i.e. he = she = it.

    ```
    |    | Singular | Dual    | Plural  |
    |----+----------+---------+---------|
    | 1P | wm / um  | wn / un | wy / uy |
    | 2P | iz / ez  | ij / ej | ix / ex |
    | 3P | at / ot  | ab / ob | ad / od |
    ```

Note that all the pronouns are a vowel and a consonant. (This is the main
exception to the rule that noun-like things end in vowels.) Furthermore the
vowel does not depend at all on the number, and the consonant does not depend at
all on the case.


<a id="org338f472"></a>

## Verbs, Part 1 &#x2013; Basic Infixes

Verbs have a root form which is inflected in various ways. In particular, the
root form of a verb is not a valid word unto itself. The most common way a verb
is inflected is to indicate its subject, object, and negation. This is done
through the use of infixes. The point at which a verb accepts infixes is always
immediately before its final vowel. To help in remembering this, the root form a
verb is always written with an asterisk indicating this position.

    wl*oc    "to eat"
    wlwmoc   eat-1S "I eat"
    wlizoc   eat-2S "you eat"

Each verb accepts up to three infixes, in the following order:

-   A subject pronoun, as described above. This is always present in the active
    voice, even if the subject is explicitly named elsewhere in the sentence.
    (It may be absent in cases where the verb form is used to derive a noun, or
    when using the passive voice.)

    ```
    Andursun  ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
    Anderson  one  cookie  eat-3S.
    Anderson eats a cookie.

    Ke   toreli  wl[at]oc.
    One  cookie  eat-3S.
    He eats a cookie.

    Andursun ke toreli *wloc. -- Incorrect, [at] infix must still be provided.
    ```

-   A negation infix `ey`. This indicates the negation/lack of the action, *not* a
    reversal of the action. The corresponding distinction can be seen in English
    where "to not do" something is distinct from "to undo" it; this is the
    former.

    ```
    Canik    kofuri  ratiq.
    Yannick  coffee  drink-3S.
    Yannick drinks coffee.

    Canik    enxura  rat[ey]iq.
    Yannick  water   drink-3S-NEG.
    Yannick does not drink water.
    ```

-   An object pronoun, as described above. This is present to the degree that
    it needs to be for disambiguation:

    ```
    Dani   qek[wm]ad.
    Danny  meet-1S.
    I meet Danny.

    Qek[wm][ot]ad.
    Meet-1S-3O.
    I meet him.

    Dani   qek[wm][ot]ad. -- Valid with redundant 3O infix; may indicate emphasis.
    Danny  meet-1S-3O.
    I meet *Danny*.
    ```

-   It is also present *without the subject pronoun* when using the passive voice:

    ```
    Torelwe    wlodoc.
    Cookie-PL  eat-3pO
    Cookies were eaten.
    ```

Note that many English words also overlap their transitive and
intransitive forms &#x2013; for example, compare "I boil the water" and "The
water boils". In Perflontus, when using the intransitive form of the verb,
the phrasing is identical to using the passive voice with the transitive
verb; the latter example can be thought of as "The water is boiled".

    ```
    Enxura   lirwmwb.
    water-R  boil-1S
    I boil the water.

    Enxura   libotwb.
    water-R  boil-3O
    The water boils / The water is boiled.
    ```


<a id="orgfd1bfec"></a>

## Pronouns, Part 2 &#x2013; This, That, A, and The

"This" and "that" are demonstrative pronouns that differ from regular nouns
primarily in that they have special handling for their objective and possessive
cases that regular nouns don't. They are otherwise handled like regular nouns,
and in particular pluralized like them. These rules will be discussed later; for
now, the following table should suffice:

    |      | Singular  | Dual      | Plural      |
    |------+-----------+-----------+-------------|
    | This | ita / eta | itw / etw | itwe / etwe |
    | That | iqa / eqa | iqw / eqw | iqwe / eqwe |

Like most Perflontus nouns (again, to be covered more thoroughly later), `ita` et
al. may also be used as demonstrative adjectives.

    Demiunu  etwe       torelwe  et   wlatoc.
    Damien   these-OBJ  cookies  FUT  eat-3S.
    Damien will eat these cookies.

    Demiunu  etwe       et   wlatoc.
    Damien   these-OBJ  FUT  eat-3S.
    Damien will eat these.

    Ita       somatotun.
    This-SUB  please-3S-3O.
    This pleases him.

There is no direct equivalent for the definite article "the". Depending on the
context it is correct to either omit any qualifier at all or to use "this" or
"that" as appropriate instead.

Similarly there is no directly equivalent to the indefinite article "a(n)". When
it is necessary to refer to some indefinite item `ke` (literally "one") is used
instead.

    Tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
    Bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
    (The) bus will arrive soon.

    Ke   tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
    One  bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
    A bus will arrive soon.

    Iqa   ke   tusvo  yipox  et   capatil.
    That  one  bus    soon   FUT  arrive-3S.
    The 1 bus will arrive soon.

## Verbs, Part 2 &#x2013; Tense, Aspect, Degree, and Reversal

Perflontus expresses two non-present tenses, past and future; two aspects,
imperfect and perfect; and two irrealis moods, the hypothetical and the
counterfactual. (Briefly, the imperfect aspect indicates that the verb action is
ongoing or otherwise incomplete; the perfect aspect indicates that the verb
action has concluded.) These expressions appear as proclitics, i.e. prefix
particles.

    | Present              | --  | Elaiza zumatuz.       | Eliza sleeps.                        |
    | Past (PST)           | im  | Elaiza im zumatuz.    | Eliza slept.                         |
    | Future (FUT)         | et  | Elaiza et zumatuz.    | Eliza will sleep.                    |
    |----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Imperfect (IMP)      | av  | Elaiza av zumatuz.    | Eliza is sleeping.                   |
    |                      |     | Elaiza imav zumatuz.  | Eliza was sleeping.                  |
    |                      |     | Elaiza etav zumatuz.  | Eliza will be sleeping.              |
    |----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Perfect (PRF)        | os  | Elaiza os zumatuz.    | Eliza has slept.                     |
    |                      |     | Elaiza imos zumatuz.  | Eliza had slept.                     |
    |                      |     | Elaiza etos zumatuz.  | Eliza will have slept.               |
    |----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Hypothetical (HYP)   | fel | Elaiza fel zumatuz.   | Eliza might sleep.                   |
    |                      |     | Elaiza avfel zumatuz. | Eliza might be sleeping.             |
    |                      |     | Elaiza imfel zumatuz. | Eliza might have slept.              |
    |----------------------+-----+-----------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Counterfactual (CFT) | gaq | Elaiza gaq zumatuz.   | Eliza would sleep (but isn't).       |
    |                      |     | Elaiza avgaq zumatuz. | Eliza would be sleeping (but isn't). |
    |                      |     | Elaiza imgaq zumatuz. | Eliza would have slept (but didn't). |

Verbs may be modified in degree or even reversed by the use of a prefix:

    |                    | Alpoxe horwmod.   | I remember that time.             |
    | Diminutive (DIM)   | Alpoxe yihorwmod. | I remember that time (a bit).     |
    | Augmentative (AUG) | Alpoxe aghorwmod. | I remember that time (intensely). |
    | Reverse (REV)      | Alpoxe vohorwmod. | I forget that time.               |

If multiple prefixes are used, DIM/AUG come before REV, i.e. `yivohor*od`, not
`voyihor*od`.


<a id="org632b9fa"></a>

## Nouns and Adjectives, Part 1 &#x2013; Number

Perflontic nouns always have at least two syllables (which is to say, vowels)
and always end in a vowel other than `w`. In their noun form, they don't take any
interesting inflections other than for number. When a noun is given the dual
number its final vowel is replaced by `w`. For the plural number, it is replaced
by `we`. Zero is considered to be part of the plural number.

    Furedu  toreli  wlatoc.
    Fred    cookie  eat-3S.
    Fred eats (a) cookie.

    Ha   torelw     wlatoc.
    Two  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
    He eats two cookies.

    Hasa   pagke  torelwe    wlatoc.
    2*216  25     cookie-PL  eat-3S.
    He eats 461 cookies.

Nouns also function as adjectives with no additional inflection. Some root forms
are translated as one part of speech or the other in English, but the parts of
speech in Perflontus should be understood as interchangeable as appropriate.

Adjectives take on the numeric inflection of the nouns they modify. In addition,
adjectives may be negated by infixing `-ay-` before their final vowel.

    Jekobu  kolbao  toreli  wlatoc.
    Jakob   green   cookie  eat-3S.
    Jakob eats (a) green cookie.

    Jekobu  ha   kolbaw    torelw     wlatoc.
    Jakob   two  green-DU  cookie-DU  eat-3S.
    Jakob eats two green cookies.

    Jekobu  kolba[ay]we   torelwe    wlateyoc.
    Jakob   green-NEG-PL  cookie-DU  eat-3S-NEG.
    Jakob does not eat non-green cookies.

Note that numbers (like `ha` "two" in the second example) are an exception to
this. They do not generally take on the same inflections as the objects they
count (including inflection due to negation or noun class), but might still be
pluralized in cases where they are used as estimation units (e.g. `yo torelwe` "36
cookies" vs `ywe torelwe` "36s of cookies").


<a id="org564eebc"></a>

## Verbs, Part 3 &#x2013; To Be

Perflontus has only one irregular verb, the copula `az` "to be". When inflected as
a main verb, `az` is inflected as `z*`:

    | z[wm] | z[at] | z[ad]    | z[at][ey] |
    | I am  | It is | They are | It is not |

It is possible for `az` to take an object "infix" in this form, e.g. `zateyot` "It
is not it", but it's unclear whether this is formally correct. A good example of
this issue is the use of "It is I" vs "It is me" in English, which raises
questions of whether the things linked by the copula should both have subjective
case and so forth. In other words, the use of `az` in these cases is undecided,
but the above object-free examples should be enough to get you through a lot of
use cases.

`az` is only "to be" in the strictly copular sense, i.e. one that expresses some
sort of identity relation. Separate verbs are used for other meanings that have
been folded into the English "to be", e.g. `z*if` "to be located", `j*if` "to
exist".

`Az` copies the number inflections from the things it links, as well as the
negative inflection of adjectives (but not nouns). This mirroring is primarily
seen for `az` but also occurs for other verbs that express some notion of
identity, e.g. `etaz` "to become".

    Didi  ruzeqo  zat.
    Didi  hunger  be-3S.
    Didi is hungry.

    Didi  ruzeq[ay]o  zat[ey].
    Didi  hunger-NEG  be-3S-NEG.
    Didi is not hungry.

    Didi  ruzeq[ay]o  zat.

## Nouns and Adjectives, Part 2 &#x2013; Verb-Derivation

Verbs may be suffixed to form nouns. These suffixes are applied to the root form
of the verb, including `az`. They are compatible with all the affixes described
previously, except for the pronoun infixes. The resulting noun/adjective is
considered a root form unto itself, so that inflections like `-ay-` that target
the final vowel of the word apply to the final vowel of the verb+suffix, not the
final vowel of the root verb.

    | Suffix type      | Noun sense                  | Adjective sense         | Suffix | Example              |
    |------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------+--------+----------------------|
    | Gerund (GER)     | The act of X-ing            | In the process of X-ing | -a     | daxa "teaching"      |
    | Agent (AGT)      | A thing that X's            | Capable of X-ing        | -afe   | daxafe "teacher"     |
    | Patient (PAT)    | A thing that is X'd         | X-able                  | -who   | daxwho "student"     |
    | Instrument (INS) | A thing that enables X-ing  | X-assisting, for X-ing  | -aqo   | daxaqo "educational" |
    | Location (LOC)   | A place where X-ing happens | X-hosting               | -ice   | daxice               |
    | Cause (CAU)      | A thing that causes X-ing   | X-causing               | -ede   | daxede               |
    | Result (RES)     | A thing that results from X | X-produced              | -oda   | daxoda               |

It should be noted that the use of these suffixes should be taken very
literally, which is one of the reasons that many suffixes will not have a clean
gloss into English. For example, it may be tempting to gloss `daxice`
"teach-location" as "school" but you could just as easily interpret that as
"classroom". The best you can really do is just substitute "teaching-place"
where it appears to avoid carrying in any unmerited assumptions. Thus to specify
"school" you might have to say `daxice veonxi` "teaching-place building" as
opposed to `daxice jiso` "teaching-place room". Of course, Perflontus should
ultimately have root words for "school" and "classroom" directly.

### Gerund Case `-a`

The gerund case of a verb is a derived noun meaning that verb's action. Some
uses of the infinitive in various languages also perform this role; in
Perflontus the two both use the gerund case.

    Zumuz[a]   Qarluz   somatun.
    sleep-GER  Charles  please-3S.
    Sleeping/to sleep pleases Charles. (Charles likes sleeping/to sleep.)

When used as an adjective this case always functions as a present participle,
and only with the connotation of a thing that is performing the action in
question. In particular, when describing something that is used *for* an action
rather than something that is performing the action itself, use the [instrumental
case](#orge566d87).

    Qarluz   eqa   zumuza     hie    zat.
    Charles  that  sleep-GER  human  be-3S.
    Charles is the sleeping person.

    *Zumuza     kworu    kworatem.  -- Incorrect, the clothes are *for* sleeping
    *sleep-GER  clothes  wear-3S
    He wears clothes that are sleeping.  -- unless the clothes are alive???

    Zumuzaqo   kworu    kworatem.
    sleep-INS  clothes  wear-3S
    He wears clothes that are for sleeping.

Also, be careful with present participial form of intransitive verbs. For
example, in English, "boiling water" refers to water that is boiling, not water
that is boiling something else. As noted in [Basic Infixes](#org338f472), a "passive voice"
style of inflection is required here. A full treatment of other participial
forms is covered in [Dependent Clauses](#org27286f5).

The resulting word acts as a root form; in particular, additional
transformations that would be applied to a noun apply to the suffixed verb as a
whole. It is still possible to apply some affixes to the verbal root before the
suffix, which may create subtly different meanings.

    Qarluz   eqa   zumuzaya       hie    zat.
    Charles  that  sleep-GER-NEG  human  be-3P.
    Charles is the person who is not sleeping.

    Qarluz   eqa   zumeyuza       hie    zat.
    Charles  that  sleep-NEG-GER  human  be-3P.
    Charles is the person who is (not-sleep)ing.  -- connotations of forced wakefulness, perhaps


<a id="org82ce738"></a>

### Agent Case `-afe` and Patient Case `-who`

The agent case of a verb is a derived noun referring to an entity that is taking
the action or is capable of taking the action. In English this functions much
like the "-er" suffix for verbs.

In the adjective form the derived word strictly denotes capability. To refer to
an entity that is currently taking the action, use the Gerund case instead.

    Maksu  hinalafe   zat.
    Max    dance-AGT  be-3P.
    Max is a dancer / Max is dance-capable.  -- context required to disambiguate

    Maksu  hinalafe   hie    zat.
    Max    dance-AGT  human  be-3P.
    Max is a dance-capable person.  -- example of grammatical disambiguation

    Maksu  hinalafaye     zatey.
    Max    dance-AGT-NEG  be-3P-NEG.
    Max is not a dancer / Max is not dance-capable.

Conversely the patient case refers to something that is the target of the
suffixed action, or capable of being such. In English the "-ee" suffix might be
used in the noun form. For the adjective form reasonable translations are
"X-able" or "for X-ing" (as an object). ("For X-ing" as a subject falls under
the instrumental case.)

    Eqwe     torelwe    wlocwho  zad.
    That-PL  cookie-PL  eat-PAT  be-3pS.
    Those cookies are for eating / edible / to be eaten.

    Equra   enxura   riqwhurayo       zatey.
    That-R  water-R  drink-PAT-NEG-R  be-3S-NEG.
    That water is not for drinking.


<a id="orge566d87"></a>

### Instrumental Case `-aqo`

The instrumental case of a verb refers to something that is used for the action
in question. This is slightly different from something that *causes* the action in
question.

    Burainu  daxaqo     kude  gaten.
    Brian    teach-INS  book  read-3S.
    Brian reads a textbook.

    Burainu  sinqeraqo     kude  gaten.
    Brian    describe-INS  book  read-3S.
    Brian reads a manual.

    Burainu  uqilwe  yelaqwe  moratuh.
    Brian    several-PL  learn-INS  own-3S.
    Brian has several things used for learning.

Note that this is more a descriptive term than anything else and should not be
used to generate specific words, primarily because many different things can be
instrumental for an action. For example a spoon can be `wlocaqo` "eat-instrument",
but so can a fork, a bowl, or a person's mouth. So it would be inappropriate to
use `wlocaqo` as a word that means specifically "spoon", unless there's other
nearby context that disambiguates it.

### Locative Case `-ice` (STUB)


<a id="orge6efcae"></a>

### Causative Case `-ede` (STUB)


<a id="orgdead0db"></a>

### Resultative Case `-oda` (STUB)


<a id="org5d9832d"></a>

## Genitive (Possessive) Case

For nouns, the possessive case is marked simply by suffixing `-ro`. This
possessive form works as both a noun and an adjective.

    Alanu-ro  kude  emkixa  zat.
    Alan-GEN  book  red     be-3S.
    Alan's book is red.

    Robu-ro  honwze  zat.
    Rob-GEN  blue    be-3S.
    Rob's is blue.

Note that there are two potential points for numeric inflection here: The root
noun is inflected to indicate the number of possessors, while the `-ro` suffix may
be inflected to indicate the number of possessed objects.

    Justiinu-rwe    kudwe    kolbawe   zad.
    Justine-GEN-PL  book-PL  green-PL  be-3pS.
    Justine's books are green.

    Yelafwe-ro        kude  wre    zat.
    Learn-AGT-PL-GEN  book  black  be-3S.
    The students' book is black.

    Yelafwe-rwe          kworwe       apwe      zad.
    Learn-AGT-PL-GEN-PL  clothing-PL  white-PL  be-3pS
    The students' clothes are white.

Possessive pronouns are formed by infixing the *subject* form of the pronoun into
`r*o`. This applies to all personal pronouns, their interrogative forms (`wat` et
al, described in more detail later), and to `ita` "this" and `iqa` "that". As with
regular nouns, it is important to pay attention to the difference in inflection
for the number of possessors vs the number of possessed things.

    Itwe     torelwe    rwmwe     zad.
    this-PL  cookie-PL  1-GEN-PL  be-3pS.
    These cookies are mine.

    Iqa   toreli  rixe    zat.
    that  cookie  2p-GEN  be-3S.
    That cookie is y'all's.

    Rwatwe      zad    na.
    Who-GEN-PL  be-3S  ?
    Whose are those?


<a id="org9a39a13"></a>

## Adjectives and Noun Classes (STUB)

Some nouns have classes which apply an additional mutation to the word. If this
occurs, all non-numeric adjectives for that noun take the mutation as well. This
mutation happens before polarity, numeric, and comparative inflection. It
applies across the copula but only when the object complement is an adjective.

-   **Bodily actions (W):** Replace the final consonant cluster `(C+)` with `\1w\1`.
-   **Light sources (T):** If the first vowel is `(V)`, prefix `\1t`.
-   **Fluids (R):** If the first two vowels are `(V)(V)`, replace with `\1r\2`. If the
    first two vowels are `(VC+)(V)`, replace with `\1ur\2`.


<a id="orgcb1ee41"></a>

## Comparatives and Superlatives (STUB)

Comparatives are formed by suffixing `'fi` . This happens after negation but before
numeric inflection. The corresponding dual and plural forms are `'fw` and `'fwe`.

Some types of adjectives do not permit standard comparative formation. Instead,
these take on `ogi'fi` as adverbial modifiers, in the same way "more" is used
instead of "-er" in English, e.g. "bigger" vs "more gigantic".

Superlatives are formed by suffixing `'` , `'w`, or `-'we` respectively. Adjectives
that use `ogi'fi` instead of `-'fi` also take `ogi'` instead of `-'`.

<a id="org6e5c387"></a>

### Notes

-   `Axwe` "every" is always plural in Perflontus; there is not singular
    inflection. It also imposes the plural inflection on anything in modifies.
    This is counter to many languages where "every" is frequently singular, e.g.
    "everything", "cada vez", "tout".
-   For similar reasons the same is true of all the quantity forms.
-   The "this" and "that" forms of most things do not take a subject/object
    inflection.
-   The various forms referring to place, time, way, and reason are
    systematically formed from their nouns, but also drop the final vowel in
    their converstion to adverbs.
-   `tizov` "this-way" and `tidul` "this-reason" are both reasonably glossed as
    "if", but `tizov` is used in cases where the if-clause indicates a mechanical
    cause for something, whereas `tidul` indicates more abstract causality.
    Another way to put it, which also applies to `alzov` and `aldul` in the opposite
    direction, is that `*zov` clauses are answers to questions better phrased as
    "how", while `*dul` clauses are answers to questions better phrased as "why".


<a id="orge6340c8"></a>

## Questions (STUB)

A sentence-final `na` marks questions. This is sufficient to make a sentence
interrogative; no further word order changes are required.

    Os wlizoc  na.
    eat-2S-PRF ?
    Have you eaten?

    Zo,  os wlwmoc.
    yes  eat-1S-PRF.
    Yes, I have eaten.

The interrogative personal pronoun is the corresponding third person pronoun
prefixed by `w-`. (`wat/wot`, `wab/wob`, `wad/wod`) This pronoun works for "who",
"what", and "which". The genitive forms are `rwato`, `rwabo`, and `rwado` &#x2013; recall
that the pronoun infixed into `r*o` indicates the number of possessors but always
takes the subjective case.

    Wad     et   qekadumad    na.
    Who-PL  FUT  meet-3pS-1O  ?
    Who will meet me?

    Wod      et   qekwmodad    na.
    Whom-PL  FUT  meet-1S-3pO  ?
    Whom will I meet?

    Rwato    daxafe     zat    na.
    Who-GEN  teach-AGT  be-3S  ?
    Whose teacher is she? -- Depending on context, might also be "Which (subject's) teacher"

Additional interrogatives are shown in the table in the previous section. In the
same way that questions don't take on a different word order than declarative
sentences, those interrogatives still take a "normal" word order, e.g. `wbwr`
"when" takes the same position that a time-marking adverb would take in a
declarative sentence.

    Janu  wbwr  et qekatuyad     na.
    Jon   when  meet-3S-1pO-FUT  ?
    When will Jon meet us?

    Janu  tiroqas    et qekatuyad.
    Jon   today-ADV  meet-3S-1pO-FUT.
    Jon will meet us today.


<a id="org4914eda"></a>

## Numbers (STUB)

Perflontus uses a base 6 system. The numbers 0-6 are `ri`, `ke`, `ha`, `pai`, `uqi`, `lo`,
and `aqe`.

Multiples of 6 up through 30 are formed by dropping all the final vowels from
the sixes digit and suffixing `aqe`: `aqe`, `haqe`, `paqe`, `uqaqe`, `laqe`. Adding units
digits replaces the final `u`; the multiples of 7 through 35 are `aqke`, `haqha`,
`paqpai`, `uqaquqi`, and `laqlo`.

The next powers of 6 up through 6<sup>5</sup> are `yo`, `sa`, `toe`, and `wdo`. To count multiples
of these, prefix the entirety of the corresponding hexit, e.g. `keyo`, `hayo`,
`paiyo`, `uqiyo`, `loyo`. Note that unlike `aqe`, in all these cases the presence of a 1
hexit is explicit: `keyo`, `kesa`, `ketoe`, `kewdo`. Additional hexits are added as
separate words, e.g. 1023 = 4423<sub>6</sub> = `uqisa uqiyo kaqpai`.

Powers of 6 above 6<sup>5</sup> are formed by naming the exponent, then replacing the
final vowel with `wdo`: `aqe` &rarr; `aqwdo`, `aqke` &rarr; `aqkwdo`, etc. These
are still "unit" power-of-6 words, and to express an actual quantity still
require the explicity 1 hexit: `keaqwdo`, `keaqkwdo`, `keaqhawdo`, etc.

Exact numbers do not take any additional inflection. For example "three dances"
is `pai hinalwla`, not `*pwpai hinalwla`. When measures of things are used &#x2013; for
example, "5 cups of water" &#x2013; the things being measured are taken as an
adjective for the number and the unit of measure. In this case we would
translate "water 5 cups", or `enxa lo janwe`. Note that not only is the noun class
applied to the unit of measure, it is also not applied to the thing being
measured, since it is not the head of its noun phrase (it is treated as an
adjective).

Inexact numbers are treated as units of measure unto themselves, e.g. "dozens of
dances" &rarr; `hinala haqwe` "dance dozens".

Ordinal numbers are formed by the suffix `-ru`. This is subject to
adverbialization by an added `-s`.


<a id="org936243d"></a>

## Conjunctions (STUB)

Conjunctions in Perflontus are particles added to the end of each element they
link, save for the last.

    Setu  ha  wibalw  -li  twipe  -li  oku    solatodov.
    Seth  2   egg-DU  -&   sugar  -&   flour  need-3S-3pO
    Seth needs two eggs, sugar, and flour.

Much like adjectives take `-s` to become adverbial when modifying verbs,
conjunctions take `-s` when linking lists of verbs or clauses.

    Ogwris        wlwmoc  -lis    zumwmuz.
    frequent-ADV  eat-1S  -&-ADV  sleep-1S
    I eat and sleep a lot.

The full list of coordinating conjunctions is as follows:

<td class="org-left">inclusive or</td>
<td class="org-left">Paliso-vo twipe orcizal na.</td>
<td class="org-left">Do you want milk and/or sugar?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that the inflection of the verb, where appropriate, is based on the
combination of all list elements for both "and" and "or". (This is in contrast
to English, where the inflection of the verb matches the *last* list element in
the "or" case.) As an example, the exclusive-or sentence above uses the
first person dual `c[wn]ub` instead of the first person singular `c[wm]ub`.

-   **-xa(s):** for, because
-   **-ja(s):** so, therefore

(A bunch of these only make sense when attaching clauses, and in those cases
we'd rather so some kind of `al* ... -ka(s)` construction. Come back to this
later.)

Section on comparatives should incorporate the conjunctions for "&#x2026;as X as Y"
and "&#x2026;more/less X than Y".


<a id="org27286f5"></a>

## Dependent Clauses (STUB)

A dependent clause is indicated by the attachment of the `-ka` suffix to its main
verb. `-kas` is used in the case where the dependent clause modifies a verb. A
reasonable English gloss for `-ka` is "that", but we'll see that many dependent
clauses use the `-ka` construction regardless of what their English translation
would use for the linking word. (One way to think about this is that many
dependent clauses in English can be rephrased to use "that" as their relative
pronoun, even if the result is more verbose.)

Dependent clauses can require the use of the relative personal pronoun, whose
forms are as follows:

The relative pronoun indicates the role that "that" within the clause if the
clause were rephrased as a standalone sentence. Further examples below will help
illustrate how this is decided.


<a id="org15f0cff"></a>

### That/What/Which Clauses and Participial Phrases

Clauses and phrases whose relative pronoun is "that", "who", "which", or "what"
use the relative personal pronoun, whose forms are as follows:

    |     | Singular | Dual    | Plural          |
    |-----+----------+---------+-----------------|
    | REL | al / ol  | ar / or | ary(u) / ory(u) |

(Like other pronouns, these may appear as standalone words in addition to being
used as verbal infixes. However, since `ary` and `ory` are invalid words due to
syllable patterns, they take on an extra vowel when appearing alone.)

The relative pronoun inflects like other person pronouns with respect to its
role in subordinate clause.

    Im   wlwm[ol]oc  -ka   um  im   somatun.
    PST  eat-1S-RO   -DEP  1O  PST  please-3S.
    What I ate pleased me.

    Av   c[ary]ub   -ka  gwmeyir.
    IMP  speak-RpS  DEP  know-1S-NEG
    I don't know who-all is speaking.

Not all noun clauses actually use their relative pronoun. For example, in some
English "that" clauses, the "that" serves no other purpose other than to mark
that a subordinate clause exists. (For example, "that a subordinate clause
exists" in the previous sentence.) In these cases a relative pronoun is not used
at all; the indication of a subordinate clause using `-ka` suffices.

    Im   wlwmoc  -ka   um  im   somatun.
    PST  eat-1S  -DEP  1O  PST  please-3S.
    That I ate pleased me.  (i.e. "The fact that I ate...")

    Im   wlwm[ory]oc  -ka   um  im   somatun.
    PST  eat-1S-RpO   -DEP  1O  PST  please-3S.
    The things that I ate pleased me.

    Imor     c[ad]ub    -ka   im   gwmeyir.
    PST-IMP  speak-3pS  -DEP  PST  know-1S-NEG.
    I didn't know that they had spoken.

    Imor     c[ary]ub   -ka   im   gwmeyir.
    PST-IMP  speak-RpS  -DEP  PST  know-1S-NEG.
    I didn't know the people that had spoken.

Note that in the second example, the use of the infixed relative pronoun `ory`
carries extra information, namely that the object of "ate" is plural. In English
the introduction of extra words "The things" is necessary to translate the
sentence. Going in the other direction, it is important to omit words of that
type, as Perflontus' noun-adjective duality presumes "things" as the noun
whenever an adjective-like thing is used with no apparent modification target.

    [Honwzwe  oryu  im   wlwmoc  -ka]   um  im   somatun.
    [blue-PL  RpO   PST  eat-1S  -DEP]  1O  PST  please-3S.
    [The blue things that I ate] pleased me.
              ^ here the pronoun is used to indicate the role of the things
                described by the subordinate clause

    [Im   wlwmoryoc   -ka]   honwzwe  um  im   somatun.
    [PST  eat-1S-RpO  -DEP]  blue-PL  1O  PST  please-3S.
    The [me-eaten] blue things pleased me.
                   ^ here 'honwzwe' suffices on its own for 'blue things'

    [Honwzwe  im   wlwmoc  -ka]   um  im   somatun.
    [blue-PL  PST  eat-1S  -DEP]  1O  PST  please-3S.
    [That I ate the blue things] pleased me.

    *[Im   wlwmoc   -ka]   honwzwe  um  im   somatun.    -- Incorrect
    *[PST  eat-1S   -DEP]  blue-PL  1O  PST  please-3S.
    *The [that I ate] blue things pleased me.

Participles in general are implemented as dependent clauses, with the exception
of the present participle of an active verb, for which the [gerund case](#orga144f79) may be
used. Generally these use a passive voice construction inside a dependent
clause, as follows:

    Enxura   lirwmwb.
    water-R  boil-1S
    I boil the water.

    Enxura   lirotwb.
    water-R  boil-3O
    The water boils.

    Lirotwb-ka   enxura   rwmiq.
    boil-3O-DEP  water-R  drink-1S
    I drink the boiling water. (I drink the water that boils / is being boiled.)
           ^ note that the R noun class is not reflected in the clause

    Im   lirotwb-ka   enxura   rwmiq.
    PST  boil-3O-DEP  water-R  drink-1S.
    I drink the boiled water. (I drink the water that was boiled.)

### Location and Timing - When, Where

Clauses with additional connotations express them with an `al-` word, placed at
the beginning of the clause. These words are defined in [Indefinite Pronouns and
Other Stand-Ins](#org2a9bf7a); the relevant ones are:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">that-place ("where")</td>
<td class="org-left">alhan</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">that-time ("when")</td>
<td class="org-left">albwr</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Various relationships between clauses can be described using these words, along
with locative descriptors.

    Alhan       xoale  jatif     -ka,  e'a   jatif.
    that-place  smoke  exist-3S  -DEP  fire  exist-3S
    Where there is smoke, there is fire.

Perflontus uses an inner-outer spatial metaphor for expressing time; things that
happened before the present are inside it, while things that happen afterward
are outside it.

### Causation and Intent - How, Why

It is common for subordinate clauses and phrases to express some kind of
causality or intent. Much like the spatial/temporal clauses, causative clauses
are introduced by one of the following adverbs:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">this-method</td>
<td class="org-left">that-method</td>
<td class="org-left">this-reason</td>
<td class="org-left">that-reason</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">tizov</td>
<td class="org-left">alzov</td>
<td class="org-left">tidul</td>
<td class="org-left">aldul</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The distinction between -method and -reason is somewhat blurred, but the general
idea is that -method should be used when the clause refers to a mechanical cause
for something, whereas -reason should be used for more abstract causes. It is
expected that certain situations could be interpreted in either way, and it is
up to the speaker's discretion to choose one.

The choice between this- and that- depends on whether the causing event is in
the subordinate clause, or in the main clause. To put it another way, if a this-
adverb is used, the direction of causality or inference flows from the
subordinate clause to the main clause. If a that- adverb is used, the opposite
is true.

    E'a   tidul        xoale  jatif      -kas      jatif.
    fire  this-reason  smoke  exists-3S  -DEP-ADV  exists-3S
    If there is smoke, there is fire.

    Xoale  tizov        e'a   jatif      -kas      jatif.
    smoke  this-method  fire  exists-3S  -DEP-ADV  exists-3S
    If there is fire, there is smoke.

In both of the above examples, a this- adverb is used because the logical
direction of events is from the dependent clause to the main clause. In the
first example, the nature of the logic is by inference, so a -reason adverb is
used. In the second example, there is a concrete, mechanical cause in play, so a
-method adverb is used.

    E'a   alzov        xoale  jatif      -kas      jatif.
    fire  that-method  smoke  exists-3S  -DEP-ADV  exists-3S
    There is fire, therefore there is smoke.

    Xoale  aldul        e'a   jatif      -kas      jatif.
    smoke  that-reason  fire  exists-3S  -DEP-ADV  exists-3S
    There is smoke, therefore there is fire.

Each of the original examples can be inverted simply by changing the adverb
used. Now in the first example, the fire in the main clause is causing the smoke
in the dependent clause, so `alzov` is used to indicate the direction and that
there is a mechanical reason behind it. Similarly, in the second case, the
existence of the fire in the dependent clause is being inferred from the smoke
in the main clause, so `aldul` is used to indicate the direction and that the
reasoning is abstract.

### Comparative Clauses (STUB)

Comparisons are always expanded to a full clause. Instead of `-ka` the
subordinate verb takes the particle `-sos`, and the use of the relative pronoun
in the clause indicates the role of the thing being compared.


<a id="org7004bb6"></a>

## Adpositions

-   -uxo
-   -uqo


<a id="orge8a6d9e"></a>

## Adverbs (STUB)

Adverbs are formed by suffixing `s`. This also applies to particles.


<a id="org5fb93d5"></a>

## Verbs, Part N &#x2013; Imperatives and Instructions (STUB)

The imperative voice is indicated by prefixing the active verb with `'`. The most
polite forms, as might be used by a manual, inflect the verb as though using the
passive voice, i.e. omitting the "you" subject. Direct, more "blunt" forms
address, add the subject pronoun infixes.

## Nouns

-   Always end in a non-"w" vowel.
-   Dual number converts the final vowel to `-w`. Plural number to `-we`.


<a id="org71ba50b"></a>

## Adjectives

-   Always end in a non-"w" vowel.
-   Inflect number to match the modified noun.
-   Come before the noun they modify.
-   Infix `-ay-` before the final vowel to negate.
-   Suffix `-s` to convert to an adverb.

# Installing and Contributing


<a id="orgf3c7f65"></a>

## Dependencies

-   **[Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/):** Python 3 would technically be good enough but 3.7 is the
    version the virtual environment happens to be installed to.
-   **[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):** Be sure that you install a version compatible with Python 3.7;
    depending on your system package manager, this may be under the \`pip3\`
    name (with \`pip\` defaulting to Python 2).
-   **[pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/):** This allows you to isolate this project's dependencies in its
    own virtual environment, without affecting your main Python
    installation.
